IGotMessage is a full-featured social media app built by me to showcase my full stack development skills. It includes core features like posts, stories, chats, video calls, and more — all designed to deliver a modern, interactive experience.

Why am I building iGotMessage? And why a social media app? A few weeks ago, I tried to integrate WhatsApp OTP using Meta’s API… But their requirements? GST, PAN, business registration… everything a solo developer like me doesn’t usually have. And I thought — why do developers always have to depend on giants like Meta for core things like authentication? Why not build something of our own? So I took a bold step. I started building a social media app — not just for fun, but to make something real that serves users and developers. That’s how iGotMessage was born — a platform that blends stories, posts, messages, and calls with privacy-first design, and also offers powerful, developer-friendly APIs for easy authentication and user engagement. And that’s not all… I’m launching my own company: jhaFusion LLC 🚀 You might laugh. “How can someone who just learned Next.js and TypeScript think of building a company?” But I’m not joking. I don’t have a degree — but I have hunger, passion, and an unshakable belief that I can build anything. This isn’t just an app. It’s a statement. The journey hasn’t been easy — I’ve struggled with deployment, authentication systems, development roadblocks — but I kept going. Today, iGotMessage is 80% complete, and what you see now is just the beginning. 📱 Here are some early screens — but trust me, a lot will change. I don’t want quantity — I want the best quality. ✨ Stay tuned for this explosive project — and many more that will follow. I’m here to create impact.
